# Data-Science-Mini-Project
A company provides a number of ways for its policyholders to make payments. While our service counselors can take payments over the phone, it is more cost-efficient for customers to make payments through our self-service channels such as online or through the automated phone system. Please use a predictive model to select people to receive a pre-emptive e-mail message designed to encourage them to pay online. You have been tasked with identifying which customers are likely to make a service payment call in the next 5 days. The attached file contains data on customers who have had a bill due in the next 5 days and whether they made a service payment call. Construct a model that predicts the likelihood that each policyholder will make a service payment call (CALL_FLAG=1). You may use whatever methods you see fit.
